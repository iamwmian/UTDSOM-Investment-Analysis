# GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard) - Comprehensive Expert Guide

## Overview

The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICSÂ®) is a comprehensive system for categorizing companies globally, jointly developed by S&P Dow Jones Indices and MSCI in 1999. It provides a consistent framework for comparing companies, sectors, and industries across countries, regions, and globally.

## GICS Structure

### Hierarchical Classification System
GICS consists of **4 hierarchical levels**:

1. **11 Sectors** - The broadest level of classification
2. **25 Industry Groups** - Groups sectors into logical clusters
3. **74 Industries** - More specific industry classifications
4. **163 Sub-Industries** - The most detailed level of classification

### Current GICS Sectors (Effective March 17, 2023)

| Sector Code | Sector Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 10 | Energy | Companies engaged in exploration, production, refining, and distribution of energy products |
| 15 | Materials | Companies that mine, refine, or process materials used in manufacturing and construction |
| 20 | Industrials | Companies providing goods and services to industrial and commercial customers |
| 25 | Consumer Discretionary | Companies producing goods and services for discretionary consumer spending |
| 30 | Consumer Staples | Companies producing essential consumer goods and services |
| 35 | Health Care | Companies providing health care goods and services |
| 40 | Financials | Companies providing financial services including banking, insurance, and investment services |
| 45 | Information Technology | Companies involved in technology hardware, software, and IT services |
| 50 | Communication Services | Companies providing communication and media services |
| 55 | Utilities | Companies providing electric, gas, and water utilities |
| 60 | Real Estate | Companies engaged in real estate development, management, and services |

### Change Tracking System
The GICS structure uses a color-coded system to indicate when changes were made:
- **Red**: Indicates changes effective in 2023
- **Blue**: Indicates enhancements in definitions in August 2024
- **Green**: Indicates enhancements in definitions in February 2025

This tracking system helps users identify which parts of the classification structure have been recently updated or modified.

## Key GICS Principles

### Classification Methodology
- **Primary Business Activity**: Companies are classified based on their principal business activity
- **Revenue-Based Classification**: Revenue is the key metric for determining classification

- **BOT Model Companies**: Infrastructure companies that opt for government tenders for construction of infrastructure (roads, buildings, etc.) and operate for a specific time period before transferring ownership back to the government. These companies are classified under "Highways and Railtracks" when they report operations/toll collection revenue rather than construction contract revenue.
- **Real Estate Services**: Excludes online real estate platforms that offer mainly information and earn revenue from pay-per-click advertising classified in the Interactive Media & Services Sub-Industry.

### REIT Classification Criteria
A company will be classified as a REIT if it meets the following criteria:
- Mentions in official documents that it operates as a REIT per the country's effective legal REIT structure
- Has a Property Trust Structure (either stand-alone trust or stapled)
- Primary investments in real estate or mortgage loans
- Majority of the company's taxable income is paid out as dividends
- If stapled, derives at least 60% of revenue from the trust arm
- Asset holdings breakdown and net earnings are also considered for GICS classification

### Additional Technical Updates (2024-2025)
Further classification considerations from MSCI:
- **Lithium Classification**: Battery-grade lithium producers to be classified under Electrical Components & Equipment, with references to lithium/battery separators in internal definitions
