## üèóÔ∏è **Investment Philosophy & Key Principles**

### **Core Investment Tenets:**
- **Productive Assets:** Investing is about owning productive assets that generate cash flow and value over time
- **Equity as Asset Bundles:** Public companies are bundles of assets known as equity securities, valued by what they earn (income) and what they own (assets)
- **Risk-Adjusted Returns:** A fund's capital should be allocated where the risk-adjusted future return is likely to be highest
- **Price vs. Value Gap:** Price (what buyers pay) and value (fundamentals) can and do diverge ‚Äî opportunity arises in that gap
- **Firm Filtering:** The investment process involves systematically filtering firms based on valuation metrics 

---

## üìö **Valuation Theory & Financial Concepts**

### **Stock Valuation Fundamentals**
**The value of a stock is the present value of all future dividends.**

**Dividend Discount Model:**
```
P‚ÇÄ = current price of the stock
P‚ÇÅ = price in one period
D‚ÇÅ = cash dividend paid at the end of the period
R = required return

P‚ÇÄ = (D‚ÇÅ + P‚ÇÅ) / (1 + R)
```

### **Valuation Ratios and Multiples**
Valuation multiples are ratios that relate a company's market value to some measure of its economic activity or asset base. They serve as standardized metrics for comparing companies across different sizes, industries, and growth stages. Multiples can also be calculated with   non-financial variables if they affect the share price. For mobile telecommunications, for example, the number of subscribers is defined as the      relevant performance indicator. For hospitals and hotels, the relevant performance indicator is the number of beds, while for social media companies, it is the number of registered users.

#### **Important Valuation Concepts:**
- **Intrinsic Value:** True fundamental value based on discounted cash flows (DCF)
- **Relative Valuation:** Comparison with similar companies or benchmarks
- **Comparables Method:** Using peer company multiples for valuation
- **Law of One Price:** Similar assets should trade at similar prices; two identical assets trade at the same price
- **GARP Strategy:** Growth at a Reasonable Price investment strategy
- **Alpha:** Excess return relative to benchmark

#### **Two Main Approaches to Multiples:**
1. **Relative Valuation:** Uses multiples from similar publicly traded companies to assess the value of an equity security against a benchmark
2. **Intrinsic Valuation:** Intrinsic value of an equity security determined from a cash flow model using growth rate of cash flows and expected return

> **Note:** Valuation multiples provide a standardized way to compare companies and assess relative value. The key is understanding both the market's current assessment (comparable approach) and what fundamentals justify (fundamental approach). Combining both methods with careful consideration of growth, risk, and industry characteristics leads to more robust valuation conclusions. Remember that multiples are tools, not definitive answers. They should be used as part of a comprehensive valuation framework that includes discounted cash flow analysis, comparable transactions, and qualitative factors.

## üî¢ **Multiples Overview**

### **Enterprise vs. Price Multiples**
- **Enterprise Value Multiples:** Place the value of the operating company in relation to quantities attributable to providers of capital (e.g., EBITDA, EBIT)
- **Price Multiples:** Divide share price by quantities allocable to equity providers (e.g., EPS, book value per share)

### **Enterprise Value vs. Equity Value**
- **Equity Value:** Market value of shareholders' stake
- **Enterprise Value:** Value of the entire business (Equity + Debt - Cash)
- **EV Advantage:** Better for comparing companies with different capital structures

### **Justified vs. Market Multiples**
- **Market Multiples:** What investors are currently paying
- **Justified Multiples:** What fundamentals suggest they should pay
- **Gap Analysis:** Helps identify mispriced securities

### **Price Multiples (Equity-Based)**
1. **P/E Ratio:** Price-to-Earnings = Share Price √∑ Annual EPS
2. **P/B Ratio:** Price-to-Book = Share Price √∑ Book Value per Share
3. **P/C Ratio:** Price-to-Cash Flow = Share Price √∑ Cash Flow per Share
4. **PEG Ratio:** Price/Earnings-to-Growth = P/E √∑ Expected Growth Rate (g)

### **Enterprise Value Multiples (Entity-Based)**
1. **EV/EBITDA:** Enterprise Value to EBITDA = Enterprise Value √∑ EBITDA
2. **EV/S:** Enterprise Value to Sales = Enterprise Value √∑ Annual Sales
3. **EV Formula:** Market Value of Equity + Debt - Cash

### **Justified Multiples (Gordon Growth Model)**
1. **Justified P/E:** P/E* = (1 - b) √ó (1 + g) √∑ (r - g)
2. **Justified P/B:** P/B* = (ROE √ó (1 - b) √ó (1 + g)) √∑ (r - g)
3. **Justified PEG:** PEG* = P/E* √∑ g

**Where:**
- **b** = Retention rate = (1 - dividend payout ratio)
- **g** = Expected growth rate = (1 - Dividend Payout) √ó ROE
- **r** = Required return on equity = (Risk-free Rate + Beta √ó Market Risk Premium)
- **ROE** = Return on Equity

**Gordon Growth Model:** P‚ÇÄ = D‚ÇÅ √∑ (r - g), where D‚ÇÅ = E‚ÇÅ √ó (1 - b), and E‚ÇÅ = E‚ÇÄ √ó (1 + g)

## üìä **Multiples In-Depth**

### **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratios**
The Price-to-Earnings ratio compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share: **P/E = Share Price √∑ Annual EPS**

**Key Components:**
- **Share Price:** Current market price per share (Market Value of Equity √∑ Number of Outstanding Shares)
*a two-for-one stock split doubles the number of shares, which halves the share price*
- **Annual EPS:** Net Income √∑ Number of Shares Outstanding
- **P/E Ratio:** How much investors pay per dollar of earnings
- **EPS:** = earnings per share which reflects the profitability of the equity

**P/E Ratio Types:**
- **Trailing P/E:** Based on past 12 months of earnings
- **Forward P/E:** Based on expected future earnings
- **Current P/E:** Based on earnings of past financial year

**Example Calculation:**
```
Company XYZ:
- Current stock price: $50
- Annual EPS: $2.50
- Trailing P/E = $50 √∑ $2.50 = 20
```
*Investors are willing to pay $20 for every $1 of annual earnings.*

**Key Assumptions:**
- Markets value stocks based on expected future earnings, not past results
- Forward P/E better reflects expectation-driven reality than trailing P/E
- Peer company valuations provide fair market benchmarks

**Real-World Example - NVIDIA vs Intel:**
- **Intel (INTC):** Lower trailing P/E due to stable but slow growth
- **NVIDIA (NVDA):** Higher forward P/E due to expected massive AI-driven growth
- **Rationale:** Paying more per ‚Ç¨1 of earnings for NVIDIA is rational if future earnings will expand sharply


### **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratios**
The Price-to-Book ratio compares a company's market value to its book value: **P/B = Share Price √∑ Book Value per Share**

**Key Components:**
- **Book Value:** Accounting value of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet
- **Book Value per Share:** (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) √∑ Number of Shares Outstanding
- **Alternative Formula:** P/B = Market Value of Equity √∑ Book Value of Equity

**Interpretation:**
- **P/B > 1:** Trading above book value (premium)
- **P/B < 1:** Trading below book value (discount)
- **P/B = 1:** Trading at book value

**Example:** P/B = $67.59 √∑ $67.25 = 1.01 ‚Üí Company trading at slight premium to book value.

**Assumptions & Limitations:**
- Works when book value of equity is positive (unlike P/E which fails with zero/negative earnings)
- **Best for:** Banks, insurers, REITs with liquid, transparent assets such as loans, securities, deposits. 
*Their market value ‚âà book value, so if the P/B deviates a lot from 1.0, it signals potential mispricing (undervaluation or overvaluation).*
- **Limitations:** Ignores intangible value drivers (human capital, brand, IP, reputation, customer relationships or proprietary technology)
- **Poor fit for:** Tech firms, consulting firms, software companies where assets aren't captured in book value, making P/B misleading.
- **Positive correlation:** High ROE stocks tend to trade at high P/B ratios

**Mispricing Matrix - P/B & Profitability Spread (ROE - r):**  
*four quadrants in the mispricing matrix for stocks, based on Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio and the profitability spread (ROE - r):*  
High P/B, High ROE - r: Fairly Valued - High P/B is justified by strong profitability (ROE exceeds cost of equity).  
High P/B, Low ROE - r: Overvalued - High P/B is not supported by weak profitability.  
Low P/B, High ROE - r: Undervalued - Strong profitability is not reflected in the low P/B, making it attractive for investors.  
Low P/B, Low ROE - r: Fairly Valued - Low P/B aligns with weak profitability.  


### **Price-to-Cash-Flow (P/C) Ratios**
The Price-to-Cash-Flow ratio compares a company's stock price to its cash flow per share: **P/C = Share Price √∑ Cash Flow per Share**

**Key Components:**
- **Cash Flow per Share:** (Net Income + Depreciation & Amortization) √∑ Number of Shares Outstanding
- **Alternative:** Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow when using Free Cash Flow
- **Advantages:** More conservative than P/E, focuses on actual cash generation, less affected by accounting policies

**Use Cases:**
- Capital-intensive industries with significant depreciation
- Companies with volatile earnings but stable cash flows

**Example:** Share price $50, Cash Flow per Share $4.00 ‚Üí P/C = $50 √∑ $4.00 = 12.5

### **PEG Ratio (Growth-adjusted P/E)**
The Price/Earnings-to-Growth ratio compares a company's P/E ratio to its expected growth rate: **PEG = P/E √∑ Expected Growth Rate (g)**

**Interpretation:**
- **PEG < 1:** Potentially undervalued relative to growth
- **PEG > 1:** Potentially overvalued relative to growth
- **PEG = 1:** Fairly valued relative to growth

**Example:** P/E = 15, g = 0.10 (10%) ‚Üí PEG = 15 √∑ 0.10 = 1.5

**Statistical Foundation:**
- Expected earnings growth rate has highest impact on P/E ratio (regression analysis)
- PEG reflects P/E ratio for one percentage point of expected earnings growth
- Low PEG ratios indicate attractive investments (low P/E + high growth)

### **GARP Strategy (Growth at Reasonable Price)**
Combines value investing (low P/E) with growth investing through PEG ratio:
- **Target:** PEG ratio of 1.0 or less
- **Rationale:** P/E ratio lower than expected earnings growth rate √ó 100

### **PEG Calculation Best Practices**
- Use **trailing P/E** (or current P/E) based on last 12 months earnings
- Avoid forward P/E to prevent double-counting future earnings
- Forward P/E would make PEG ratio artificially low

### **Enterprise Value Multiples**

#### **EV/EBITDA Ratio**
Enterprise Value to EBITDA accounts for a company's entire capital structure: **EV/EBITDA = Enterprise Value √∑ EBITDA**

**Components:**
- **Enterprise Value:** Market Value of Equity + Debt - Cash
- **EBITDA:** Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization
- **Forward EV/EBITDA:** EV √∑ Expected Future EBITDA

**Example:** EV = $34,938M, EBITDA = $5,962M ‚Üí EV/EBITDA = $34,938M √∑ $5,962M = 5.86

**Advantages:**
- Eliminates distortions from different capital intensities and tax rates 
- Better for capital-intensive sectors (telecom, utilities, steel, infrastructure)
- Approximates pre-capex operating performance

**Limitations:**
- Free cash flow to firm has stronger link to equity valuation than EBITDA

#### **EV/Sales (EV/S) Ratio**
The Enterprise Value to Sales ratio compares a company's enterprise value to its revenue: **EV/S = Enterprise Value √∑ Annual Sales**

**Components:**
- **Enterprise Value:** Market Value of Equity + Debt - Cash
- **Sales:** Total revenue for the period

**Advantages:**
- Useful for companies with negative earnings or high growth
- Less volatile than earnings-based multiples
- Good for comparing companies in different growth stages
- Typically ranges from 1x to 4x depending on industry

**Example:** EV = $100M, Annual Sales = $50M ‚Üí EV/S = $100M √∑ $50M = 2.0

### **Gordon Growth Model & Justified Multiples**
By calculating the P/E ratio using a cash flow model, it is possible to determine the share price that must be paid for one unit of earnings. This incorporates forecast fundamentals of profitability, growth, and risk.

#### **Justified P/E Ratio Derivation**
```
P‚ÇÄ = D‚ÇÅ √∑ (r - g)
P/E = [D‚ÇÅ √∑ E‚ÇÅ] √ó [E‚ÇÅ √∑ (r - g)] = (Dividend Payout) √ó [1 √∑ (r - g)]
Justified P/E = (1 - b) √ó (1 + g) √∑ (r - g)
```

**Where:**
- **b** = Retention rate (1 - dividend payout ratio)
- **1 - b** = Payout ratio of earnings
- **P‚ÇÄ** = Current stock price
- **D‚ÇÅ** = Expected dividend next year
- **r** = Required rate of return
- **g** = Expected growth rate

**Example Calculation:**
```
Company with:
- Retention rate (b) = 0.7356
- Growth rate (g) = 2.8%
- Required return (r) = 6.7%

Justified P/E = (1 - 0.7356) √ó (1 + 0.028) √∑ (0.067 - 0.028)
            = 0.7356 √ó 1.028 √∑ 0.039
            = 0.756 √∑ 0.039 = 19.39
```

#### **Key Relationships**
- **P/B*** = **P/E*** √ó **ROE**
- **PEG*** = **P/E*** √∑ **g**
- **g** = **b** √ó **ROE**

#### **Fundamental Assumptions**
- For a given growth rate, the higher (lower) the earnings payout ratio, the higher (lower) the P/E ratio. This relationship can be explained by the fact that companies with low investment needs have higher earnings payout ratio and hence a higher P/E ratio than firms of high capital expenditure.
- A stock has the same price as the stock of an identical peer company if the forecast fundamentals such as cash flows, growth rate, and expected return are the same. The implicit assumption is that stocks in the same industry sector have the same risk, growth, and cash flow patterns and are therefore comparable to each other.

#### **Interpretation Framework**
- **P/E_actual > P/E*** ‚Üí Potentially overvalued
- **P/B_actual < P/B*** ‚Üí Potentially undervalued
- **PEG* < 1** ‚Üí Undervalued relative to growth
- **PEG* > 1** ‚Üí Overvalued relative to growth

#### **Fundamental Drivers of Justified Multiples**
- **Higher growth (g)** ‚Üí Higher justified multiples
- **Higher profitability (ROE)** ‚Üí Higher justified multiples
- **Higher risk (r)** ‚Üí Lower justified multiples
- **Higher retention (b)** ‚Üí Higher justified multiples

### **Multiples Classification & Ranges**

| Multiple Type | Description | Common Range |
|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| **P/E** | Price to Earnings | 10-25x |
| **PEG** | Price/Earnings to Growth | Varies by growth |
| **P/B** | Price to Book Value | 0.5-3.0x |
| **P/C** | Price to Cash Flow | 5-15x |
| **EV/EBITDA** | Enterprise Value to EBITDA | 5-12x |
| **EV/S** | Enterprise Value to Sales | 1-4x |

**Categories of Multiples:**
- **Price Multiples:** Both numerator and denominator are equity-related (share price vs. EPS, book value, free cash flow)
- **Value Multiples:** Based on total capital-related variables (enterprise value vs. EBIT, EBITDA, free cash flow to firm, sales)

### **Overvaluation/Undervaluation Matrix**
- High P/B + High ROE = Potentially overvalued
- High P/B + Low ROE = Significantly overvalued
- Low P/B + High ROE = Potentially undervalued
- Low P/B + Low ROE = Significantly undervalued

### **Growth-Adjusted Valuation**
- **High-growth companies** deserve higher multiples
- **PEG ratio** helps compare companies with different growth rates
- **Growth must be sustainable and funded**

### **Risk Adjustment**
- **Higher risk** requires higher returns (lower multiples)
- **Beta** measures systematic risk
- **Required return** adjusts for company-specific risk factors

## üè≠ **Industry-Specific Considerations**

Different industries have different typical multiple ranges due to varying growth prospects, risk profiles, capital intensity, and profitability characteristics.

### **High-Growth Industries (Tech, Biotech)**
- **Higher P/E multiples:** 20-30x (justified by growth expectations)
- **Lower P/B ratios:** Due to intangible assets not captured in book value
- **Higher PEG ratios:** Acceptable given growth prospects

### **Mature Industries (Utilities, Consumer Staples)**
- **Lower P/E multiples:** 10-15x (stable but slow growth)
- **Higher P/B ratios:** 1.5-2.5x (tangible assets, stable valuations)
- **More stable valuations:** Less volatility in multiples

### **Cyclical Industries (Manufacturing, Commodities)**
- **Volatile multiples:** Wide swings with economic cycles
- **P/B ratios often below 1:** During economic downturns
- **EV/EBITDA preferred:** Better for cyclical companies with varying capital structures

---

## ‚ùì **Key Questions & Rationale**

### **Why Use Ratios Like P/E and M/B?**
- **P/E (Price-to-Earnings):** Tells how much investors are paying for each dollar of earnings. Lower is often "cheaper," which can mean higher possible returns. Reflects company profitability directly.
- **Market-to-Book (M/B):** Tells how much investors are paying for each dollar of equity (assets minus debts). Lower can mean "safer" or "undervalued" unless there's a fundamental reason for pessimism (= Market Value / Book Value).

### **Limitations to P/E and M/B Ratios**
- **P/E Vulnerabilities:** Subject to accounting manipulation and earnings volatility
- **M/B Limitations:** Book value may not reflect true economic value, especially for intangible-heavy companies

### **Why Aggregate by Sector and Quarter?**
- **Sector Grouping:** Companies with similar drivers, enabling apples-to-apples comparisons
- **Quarterly Aggregation:** Removes short-term noise, reveals patterns/trends over longer horizons
- **Time Horizon Advantage:** Think in 5-10 year terms rather than 6-month blips

### **Why GICS over NAICS for Sector Classification?**
- **GICS Advantages:** Globally recognized standard designed for financial markets, used by investors and analysts worldwide. Hierarchical structure (11 sectors ‚Üí 24 groups ‚Üí 69 industries ‚Üí 158 sub-industries). Classifies by revenue generation and market competition, aligning with investor priorities.
- **NAICS Limitations:** U.S./North America focused, designed for government statistical reporting, less relevant for global investment analysis.

### **Industry Classification Systems Overview: GICS, ICB, SIC, NAICS codes**
- GICS: Global Industry Classification Standard (MSCI/S&P): 2-digit sectors ‚Üí 4-digit groups ‚Üí 6-digit industries ‚Üí 8-digit sub-industries
- SIC: Standard Industrial Classification : 4-digit codes for principal products and services
- NAICS: North American Industry Classification System : 6-digit codes classifying economic activities by sector, subsector, and industry
- ICB: Industry Classification Benchmark (FTSE) : Industry (2 digits), Supersector (4 digits), Sector (6 digits), and Subsector (8 digits)

### **Why Compute Statistics (Mean, Median, Variance)?**
- **Mean/Median:** Show typical sector valuation - what's "normal" currently
- **Variance:** Measures risk/uncertainty; higher variance indicates riskier sector selection
- **Median Advantage:** Unlike arithmetic mean, median is unaffected by outliers and more suitable for benchmarks

### **Why Allocate Based on These Metrics?**
- **Rational Allocation:** Direct capital toward sectors where value-price gap is widest and uncertainty manageable

**Allocation Examples:**
- **Sector A:** Low P/E + Low variance ‚Üí Cheap and stable ‚Üí Allocate more capital
- **Sector B:** High P/E + High variance ‚Üí Expensive and risky ‚Üí Avoid or deprioritize

**Real-World Application:**
*Comparing Technology (high P/E, high variance) vs. Utilities (low P/E, low variance):*
- If sectors grow earnings similarly, paying 40x earnings for Tech is riskier than 15x for Utilities unless Tech has superior fundamentals
- Fund capital naturally shifts toward sectors offering more earnings/asset value per dollar invested

**Core Investment Philosophy:**
- Own assets where you get most future earnings per dollar today, with risk you can stomach.
- Use clean, comparable company data to spot these opportunities at the sector level.
- Allocate more where the value/price gap is wide, but only if you understand the variance (risk) behind those numbers.

### **Phase 3: Sector Analysis**

#### **Methodology Overview**

**GICS Sector Classification:**
- Uses GICS sector codes (`gsector`) for sector-level aggregation
- Groups firms into 11 GICS sectors for superior investment analysis (vs. NAICS)
- Enables apples-to-apples sector comparisons

**Sector Mapping:** Energy(10), Materials(15), Industrials(20), Consumer Discretionary(25), Consumer Staples(30), Health Care(35), Financials(40), Information Technology(45), Communication Services(50), Utilities(55), Real Estate(60)

**Statistical Analysis:**
- Computes mean, median, standard deviation, and variance for each sector-quarter combination
- Performs time series analysis to identify valuation trends across quarters
- Generates panel dataset: `11 sectors √ó 62 quarters √ó 2 ratios √ó 4 statistics`

#### **Dataset Summary**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Input dataset** | Compustat Quarterly Ratios Time-Series (Phase 2 output) |
| **Total observations** | 522,018 |
| **Unique companies** | 15,474 (across 11 GICS sectors) |
| **Time coverage** | 62 calendar quarters (2010-Q1 through 2025-Q2) |
| **After cleaning** | 402,263 observations |
| **Data retention rate** | 77.1% |
| **Primary data loss sources** | Loss-making companies (negative EPS), zero book value |

#### **Analysis Process**
- Groups data by `['gsector', 'quarter']` for sector-quarter aggregation
- Calculates statistics for every sector-quarter combination
- Removes infinite/null ratios for robust statistical analysis
- Produces comprehensive panel dataset for investment decision-making

### **Phase 4: Investment Decisions**

#### **Strategic Objectives**

1. **Relative Returns Analysis**
   - Compare sector portfolio returns against market benchmarks
   - Evaluate S&P 500 index and sector-specific ETFs (XLK, XLF, etc.)
   - Assess whether value-based strategies outperform passive benchmarks

2. **Risk-Adjusted Portfolio Construction**
   - **Aggressive Approach:** Exclude sectors with high valuations + high variance (expensive & uncertain)
   - **Conservative Approach:** Allocate to sectors with low valuations + stable variance (bargains with margin of safety)

#### **Investment Allocation Framework**

##### **Step 1: Data Collection**
- Pull quarterly P/E and M/B ratios for all firms in each sector
- Ensure comprehensive coverage across all 11 GICS sectors

##### **Step 2: Statistical Aggregation**
- Calculate mean and variance for each sector-quarter combination
- Generate risk-return profiles for each sector

##### **Step 3: Scoring System**
- Prioritize sectors that are "cheaper" (lower valuations) and more stable (lower variance)
- Implement quantitative scoring algorithm for objective decision-making

##### **Step 4: Portfolio Allocation**
- Assign capital weights based on composite scores
- Apply diversification limits to manage concentration risk
- Balance between high-conviction opportunities and risk management

##### **Step 5: Performance Monitoring**
- Track quarterly portfolio results against benchmarks
- Adjust allocations based on changing market conditions
- Rebalance periodically to maintain target exposures

#### **Forecast Accuracy & Assumption Testing**

**Key Investment Principle:** Returns depend not just on numbers, but on the validity of underlying assumptions. Investment success often hinges on the "why" behind decisions rather than the numbers themselves.

- **Growth Assumption Validation:** Test reasonableness of earnings growth projections
- **Valuation Model Stress Testing:** Assess sensitivity to different scenarios
- **Benchmark Comparison:** Evaluate strategy performance vs. passive alternatives
- **Risk Factor Analysis:** Understand drivers of sector volatility and correlations
